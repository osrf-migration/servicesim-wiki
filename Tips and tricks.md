## See the world origin in Gazebo

1. On Gazebo's top menu, choose `View`
1. `Origin` will already be checked, uncheck it and then check it again
1. Zoom out so you can see the red-green-blue lines which correspond to the world's X-Y-Z axes and meet at the world origin.

## Check robot / guest positions

While the simulation is running, you can:

1. (Optional) Pause it
1. On the 3D view, select the robot - it will also be selected on the left panel
1. On the left panel, expand `pose` and see the robot's current X-Y-Z Roll-Pitch-Yaw coordinates in the world frame
1. Do same for the guest
